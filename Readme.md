# Some experiments with MVC 5 concepts that might be helpful for an LOB app.

### This is more of a self-learning experimentation process. Will initially aim to investigate the following:

	1. Typescript and how it might be applicable.
	2. UI testing with Jasmine and Qunit
	3. Utilizing "async" controllers for performance reasons
	4. How to navigate "Areas" with Html helpers.
	5. LESS: to make CSS less painful to maintain.
	6. Overriding ViewData provider to use cookies instead of session state to persist data between requests.
