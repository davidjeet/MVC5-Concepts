# Some experiments with MVC 5 concepts that might be helpful for an LOB app.

### This is more of a self-learning experimentation process. Will initially aim to investigate the following:

	1. Figure out how to do typescript compile automatically
	2. Figure out how to do alerts with viewbag
	3. Testing of javascript *** NEW ***
	4. How to navigate "Areas" with Html helpers (look at example of authentication).
	5. Unit testing MVC controllers
	6. The role of Knockout.js (trying to leverage the benefits of databinding goodness the heaviness of angular.js)
